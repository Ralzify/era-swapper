to use, click code, then click download zip. Then, extract the zip file using WINRAR (https://www.rarlab.com/rar/winrar-x64-623.exe), and copy the pak and sig you want, then press windows key and r (win+r), and type %localappdata%. From here, go to FortniteGame, Saved, and make a folder called "Paks". Paste the paks you want in here.

if you have some paks youve made/want to share, reach out to me on either twitter (@RALZLFY), or discord (@ralzify)
