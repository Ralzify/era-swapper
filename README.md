# HOW-TO-USE

- Click the green "<> Code â–¼" Symbol, then click "Download ZIP". 
- Extract using [WinRar](https://www.rarlab.com/rar/winrar-x64-700.exe) or [7zip](https://7-zip.org/a/7z2301-x64.exe). 
- Find the swap(s) you want to use, copy them, then press the windows key and r (win+r), and type "%localappdata%". 
- From here, go to FortniteGame, Saved, and make a folder called "Paks". Put the paks in there.

# NOTES:

- We are NOT responsible for a ban using these. If you're cautious then you'll be fine.
- If you know how, and plan to make your own paks, *make sure you're putting the _P at the end of the name **(ex: pakchunkLightning-WindowsClient_P.pak)***
- If you would like to add to this github, either open a pull request, or DM me on discord (@ralzify) and I'll add the paks. Make sure they are for 8.51.
